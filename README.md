# HiOrg-Public-Calendar-PWA
PWA web app to display a public calendar from HiOrg Server

HiOrg Server (www.hiorg-server.de) offers a tool to create a public calendar. The webpage created over this tool isn't much attractive and not good for showing on a big display on the entrance of a building. So we created our own calendar to display on a big TV. You can find a demo under https://cal.7oi.de/. Therefore we use the public calendar from our friends in Bad Cannstatt. Thanks for this.

## Modify to your own calendar
You can create your own calendar. For his you need a link to your HiOrg Servers JSON file. You can create this link on hiorg-server.de under Kalender -> verkn√ºpfen..., where you can select which events you want to show. Copy the url shown and paste it after fetch in line 45.

For the PWA you need to change the URL in manifest.json to your own webservers address.

If you want to use a light theme instead of the dark theme you can uncomment the part /* Default (light) theme */ in style.css.
